Japan is administratively divided into 47 prefectures. These are conventionally grouped into nine regions, listed here from north to south:


Regions of Japan
 	Hokkaido (Central Circuit, Eastern Circuit, Northern Circuit, Southern Circuit)
Northernmost island and snowy frontier. Famous for its wide open spaces, cold winters, and Ainu culture.
 	Tohoku (Aomori, Iwate, Akita, Miyagi, Yamagata, Fukushima)
Largely rural north-east part of the main island Honshu, best known for seafood, skiing and hot springs.
 	Kanto (Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa)
Coastal plain of Honshu, includes the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama.
 	Chubu (Niigata, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Yamanashi, Nagano, Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu)
Mountainous middle region of Honshu, dominated by the Japan Alps and Japan's fourth-largest city, Nagoya.
 	Kansai (Shiga, Mie, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Wakayama, Hyogo)
Western region of Honshu, ancient capital of culture and commerce, including the cities of Osaka, Kyoto, Nara and Kobe.
 	Chugoku (Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi)
South-westernmost Honshu, a rural region best known for the cities of Hiroshima and Okayama.
 	Shikoku (Kagawa, Ehime, Tokushima, Kochi)
Smallest of the four main islands, a destination for Buddhist pilgrims, and Japan's best white-water rafting.
 	Kyushu (Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Oita, Kumamoto, Miyazaki, Kagoshima)
Southernmost of the four main islands, birthplace of Japanese civilization; largest cities Fukuoka and Kitakyushu.
 	Okinawa (Okinawa Island, Daito Islands, Miyako Islands, Yaeyama Islands)
This semi-tropical southern island chain was an independent kingdom until it was annexed in 1879; its traditional customs and architecture are very different from those of the rest of Japan.
